## Blockchain Basics
- It is a decentralized system. Decentralized means the network is **powered by its users (Peers)** without having any third party, central authority or middleman controlling it.
- Every Peer has a record of the complete history of all transactions as well as the balance of every account.
- This bookkeeping is not controlled by one party or a central authority (E.g. Central Bank).
- Its all Public, and available in one digital ledger which is fully distributed across the network. i.e. everybody sees what everybody is doing.
- The Blockchain acts as a public ledger.
- In blockchain all the transactions are logged including:
    * Time
    * Date
    * Participants
    * Amount of every single transaction
- Each node in the network owns the full copy of the blockchain.
- The nodes automatically and continuously agree about the current state of the ledger and every transaction in it.
- If anyone attempts to currupt a transaction, the nodes will not arrive at a **consensus** and hence will refuse to incorporate the transaction in the blockchain.
- So every transaction is public and thousands of nodes unanimously agreed that a transaction has occurred on date X at time Y.
- Everyone has access to shared single public source of truth.

## Blockchain Technology Benefits
- **Security**:
    * Since Blockchain is a distributed concensus based architecture, it's eliminates single point of failure and reduces the need for data intermediaries such as transfer agents or messaging system operators.
    * It helps prevent frauds and malicious third parties from doing bad things.
    * Its not fullproof and we do hear about hacks in the box or certainly in cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency exchanges but its very very difficult to hack or manipulate.
- **Transparency**:
    * It provides transparency and in place multialise standards, protocols and shared processes.
- **Trust**:
    * Its transparent and the immutable ledger makes it easy for different parties in a business network to collaborate, manage data and reach agreements.
- **Programmability**:
    * Its programmable, so its able to execute things like **smart contracts** and help be more tamper proof and have deterministic software that automates the business logic.
- **Privacy**:
    * It provides privacy.
- **High-Performance**:
    * It can be a private network of hybrid networks and they are engineered to sustain hundreds/millions of transactions per second and also handle periodic surges in network activity.
- **Scalability**:
    * Its highly scalable.
